# Hotel Reservation Application

## Project Overview

The Hotel Reservation application is a Java-based project designed to simulate a basic hotel booking system. As part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, this project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, focusing on object-oriented programming principles, data handling, and user interaction through the console. Users can add customers, create reservations, and view bookings in a simplified hotel reservation system.

### Features

**Customer Management:** Add new customers to the hotel reservation system.
**Room Management:** Ability to add rooms and view all available rooms.
**Reservation System:** Create reservations for customers with available rooms.
**View Reservations:** List all reservations and the rooms booked by a particular customer.
